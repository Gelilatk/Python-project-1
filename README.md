**Introduction**

These projects were implemented during data analytics courses at Datanomics academy. There are five beginner-friendly Python projects designed to solidify core introduction to python programming concepts in which each project simulates a real-world application. 

**Goal**

The goal of these projects was to understand and apply beginner level/ fundamentals of Python programming skills through hand-on applications. By completing these projects, we gained concepts like:

        •	Controlling program flow with loops and conditionals.
        
        •	Handling user input and creating interactive experiences.
        
        •	Effectively using Python's core data structures like lists, dictionaries, and tuples.
        
        •	Implementing basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.
        
        •	Formatting output for clear user communication.
        
        •	Solving logical problems. 
        
**Walk through the tasks**

   ** 1.	Vending Machine Program **
   
    The program simulates a simple vending machine interface by starting to display a menu of items. Then users repeatedly select items by number, and their choices are  accumulated in a "cart." Finally, the session ends with the "done" command, triggering a formatted receipt that lists all selected items and the total cost. The key skills applied were while loops, input(), if/elif/else conditionals, managing dictionaries, using sum(), and string formatting with print.
    
    **2.	Simple Grocery Cart Checkout
    
    The program builds a dynamic shopping cart that calculates a bill. Beginning with users add items to their cart by typing the name of a grocery item from a predefined list, the program asks for the quantity for each valid item and updates the cart. Lastly, by typing "checkout," a detailed bill is displayed, showing itemized costs, subtotals, and the final total. The key skills applied were dictionary manipulation, for/while loops, converting input() types, basic math operations, and handling invalid user input.
    
    **3.	To-Do List App (Text-Based)**
    
    The program was made to create a personal text-based task manager to track activities. The program allows users to add tasks with a priority, view the current list, delete tasks by their list number, and list tasks as complete. Then when the user wants to finish, he/she types "exit," at which point it provides a summary of completed vs. pending tasks. Here the key skills applied were list operations, string parsing (e.g., splitting "Buy milk - high"), persistent loops, and implementing basic CRUD functionality.
    
    **4.	Movie Ticket Booking Simulation**
    
    The program simulates the process of booking tickets for movies. In the beginning the program presents a list of movies, showtimes, and prices, then the user selects a movie and specifies the number of tickets. After this, the program calculates the price of each ticket and asks if they want to book another. Finally, when the user has finished, a summary of all bookings and the total cost is displayed. The key skills practiced here were, nested dictionaries, nested loops, conditional logic for user prompts, and running totals.
    
    **5.	Quiz Game**
    The program was made to develop an interactive quiz that scores the user's performance. It uses a dictionary, where each key represents a quiz question and the value helps to find the answer. A score counter starts at 0 for the user to record their performance. The heart of the game is a loop that takes the user through each question in the dictionary, asking them for their answer each time. The user's response is compared to the correct answer and each time the user responds correctly, the program offers positive encouragement, then updates the score. For any incorrect response, the program displays the correct answer. Finally, after the user has answered each question, the loop will end, and the program will provide the user with their score, explaining how many questions they answered correctly, before quitting. To perform this the key skills applied were dictionary iteration with a for loop, capturing user input(), conditional checks (if/else), using a counter variable to track score, string methods (.lower()), and accessing dictionary values by key.
